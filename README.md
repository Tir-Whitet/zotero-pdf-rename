This is a Zotero plugin that allows you to rename PDF files in your Zotero library using custom rules.

**Note**: *This plugin only works on **Zotero 7.0** and above*.

## Usage

Select one or more items in your Zotero library and right click to open the context menu. Select `Rename PDF attachments` from the menu.

Then the PDF files will be renamed according to the custom rules you set in the plugin preferences(not implemented yet).

### Default rules

This plugin will read the journal name and year from the metadata of the item and rename the PDF file as follows:

```
{short journal name}_{year}_{short title}.pdf
```

For example, the PDF file of the item below will be renamed as `TPAMI_2016_Go-ICP.pdf`.

The `short title` is read from the `Short Title` field of the item. If the `Short Title` field is empty, the plugin will use the `Title` field instead.

### Journal tags

The `short journal name` is generated by selecting the first capital letter of each word in the journal name. For example, `IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence` will be converted to `TPAMI`, while `IEEE` will be ignored.

However, `ACM Transactions on Graphics` will be converted to `TG` rather than `TOG` in current version. This is because the word `on` is ignored in the conversion.
A better method is manually adding the short name of the journal in the `Tags` of the item.

For example, you can add `Jab/#TOG` to the `Tags` of the item, and the plugin will use `TOG` as the short name of the journal.

**Note**: the plugin will first read the `Jab/#` tag in the `Tags` as the short name. If there is no `Jab/#` tag, the plugin will automatically extract the short name from the full name of the journal.

PS: It is recommended to install the plugin [MuiseDestiny/zotero-style](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-style) for a better experience.

### Short Cut

Now, we can use `control+D` to rename the PDF files. Moreover, we can customize the short cut in the `Preferences` of Zotero. 

The custom short cut can be a combination of the modifier keys and another key. The modifier keys can be `alt`, `control`, `meta` and `accel`, while another key can be any key on the keyboard.

The following table shows the corresponding modifier keys on Windows and Mac.

| modifier  | Windows            | Mac       |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| `alt`     | Alt                | ⌥ Option  |
| `control` | Ctrl               | ⌃ Control |
| `meta`    | ❌  *Not supported* | ⌘ Command |
| `accel`   | Ctrl               | ⌘ Command |


## Future work

- [x] Add a short cut for the renaming function
- [ ] Preferences panel to allow users to customize the rules.
- [ ] Better way to extract the short name of the journal.
